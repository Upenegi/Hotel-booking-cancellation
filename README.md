# Hotel-booking-cancellation
This Python project involves comprehensive analysis and visualization of hotel booking and cancellation data. The insights extracted are as follows:

1. **Cancellation Impact:** The bar graph showcases that 37% of reservations have been cancelled, significantly affecting the hotel's revenue. This emphasizes the need for effective cancellation management strategies.

2. **Hotel Preference:** City hotels have a higher number of bookings compared to Resort hotels, which might indicate varying traveler preferences between city and resort destinations.

3. **Pricing Dynamics:** A visual representation of Average Daily Rates (ADR) in City and Resort hotels reveals rate fluctuations. Resort hotels sometimes have higher ADR, potentially due to weekend and holiday surges.

4. **Seasonal Trends:** Analysis of reservation levels by month highlights August as having the most bookings, while January sees the most cancellations. This suggests potential strategies for focusing marketing efforts during peak months.

5. **Price-Driven Cancellations:** The bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are more frequent when prices are higher. This indicates that pricing plays a significant role in influencing guests' decisions to cancel reservations.

6. **Top Cancelled Country:** Portugal emerges as the top country with the highest number of reservation cancellations, indicating a potential area for targeted interventions.

7. **Market Segments:** Analysis of market segments reveals that 46% of clients come from online travel agencies, suggesting a significant reliance on third-party platforms.

8. **ADR and Cancellation:** Comparison of ADR between not cancelled and cancelled reservations reaffirms that higher ADR leads to increased cancellations, reinforcing earlier findings.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Pricing Strategy:** Lowering rates during high cancellation periods and offering discounts can mitigate cancellations and enhance guest retention.

2. **Resort Hotel Strategy:** Given the higher cancellation ratio for Resort hotels, implementing weekend and holiday discounts could stimulate bookings.

3. **Targeted Marketing:** Initiating campaigns during January could help counteract the highest cancellation rates during this month.

4. **Quality Enhancement:** Focusing on improving hotel quality and services, particularly in Portugal, may help decrease the overall cancellation rate.

Overall, the project underscores the importance of pricing, timing, and quality in managing hotel cancellations and optimizing revenue.
